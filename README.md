## Description

This web application was created as a maturita (high school thesis) project on the topic of blockchain and cryptocurrencies. It enables users to:
- Create wallets with ECDSA cryptographic keys.
- Check the balance of wallets.
- Send signed transactions between wallets.
- Mine blocks using proof-of-work.
- Save and load the blockchain to/from JSON files.

The project is a simplified demonstration of cryptocurrency principles, inspired by systems like Bitcoin, but designed as a centralized educational tool. It lacks advanced features such as decentralization or dynamic mining difficulty adjustments.
